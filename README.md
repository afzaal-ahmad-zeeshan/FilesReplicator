# FilesReplicator

A WPF application with .NET 6 to replicate the same files multiple directories. 

Running the application on the terminal-only, build the project and run:

```shell
$ ./FilesReplicator --onlycli --file "C:\\Users\\afzaa\\Desktop\\dummy.txt"
```

## Schema

The structure of the model is not yet confirmed. I am building this application
to help me with my video course structuring.
