# Formatters

The application expects to work with formatters with the string. I am considering
the following formatters:

* {index} - the index in the loop.
* {parentName} - the name of the parent directory
* {parentIndex} - the index of parent directory

> I am over the fence with the casing, kebab case? Title case? Pascal case?
